```

## Future of Sifo Framework

### Support

* Sifo is actively maintained cost it is used by some companies in production
* Fill free to open issue or a pull request for any kind of fix or improvement

### New Features

* Although, the framework is actively maintained, we aren't go to add any new feature, 
Sifo has a lot of features that we are trying to remove in order to archieve a more cleaner integration between the 
framework and the business code. 

### Deprecations

* Use only classes located inner `Sifo\`  namespace every other library included will be deleted in future releases

### Maybe

* Allow Framework Agnostic Controllers
* Clean package without external libraries
